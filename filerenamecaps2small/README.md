Linux ShellScript to Rename caps letter file names to small letter file names in current working directory:

up2low finds the files in the current working directory and find the awk script then apply the logic

rename.awk used to aplly the logic and rename

i)   It won't rename the directory
ii)  leave the file that have the small letter already
iii) leave the rename.awk and up2low because these are source and destination file
